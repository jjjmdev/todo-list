<!-- I think `priority` property should be a number. -->
<!-- Can also add `notes` property -->
<!-- Multiple projects and to-do item goes into the selected project -->
Application logic is separate from DOM-related stuff
Bulma for UI
    View all projects.
    View all todos in each project (probably just the title and duedateâ€¦ perhaps changing color for different priorities).
    Expand a single todo to see/edit its details.
    Delete a todo.
Add a `date` using date-fns
<!-- Saving data using localStorage -->
<!-- Function that checks localStorage during init -->
<!-- Inspect data of localStorage using DevTools -->
<!-- use JSON -->
