Application logic is separate from DOM-related stuff
    View all todos in each project (probably just the title and duedateâ€¦ perhaps changing color for different priorities).
    Expand a single todo to see/edit its details.
    Delete a todo.
Add a `date` using date-fns
Completed: Boolean, true or false
Pag completed, lower opacity
